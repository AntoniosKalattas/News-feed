The International Criminal Court (ICC) has received a surge of support from dozens of countries, including key European nations like the UK, Germany, and France. This wave of solidarity comes in the wake of sanctions imposed by former US President Donald Trump's administration on ICC officials.  These nations, representing a majority of the ICC's member states, have issued strong statements affirming the court's "vital" role in upholding international justice and combating impunity for grave crimes.  They condemn any measures that undermine the court's independence and ability to operate effectively. This united front highlights a growing international resistance to unilateral actions against global institutions and underscores the perceived importance of the ICC in ensuring accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity, signaling a potential point of tension between a future Trump administration and the international community.

Donald Trump, in his third week back in office, wasted no time in reasserting his policy agenda across numerous fronts. His administration swiftly took action on a diverse range of issues, reflecting his characteristic broad, and often controversial, approach.  Notable actions included implementing a ban on transgender women competing in women's sports, a move applauded by his conservative base but criticized by LGBTQ+ rights advocates. He also weighed in on the Gaza conflict, suggesting future US involvement after current hostilities cease, a proposal raising eyebrows internationally. Additionally, Trump reinstated tariffs on small packages from China, signaling a continuation of his trade protectionist policies.  These early actions demonstrate a clear intention to quickly implement his agenda and maintain a prominent position on both domestic and international issues.
